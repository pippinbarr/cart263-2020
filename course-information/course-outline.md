## Description

Programming isn't just about knowing the ins and outs of your chosen programming language, it's also about leveraging the code already written by others in your quest to create truly interesting software. In this course we focus on libraries as a way to extend on our capacities and to open up new avenues for creative expression through code. Students will spend their time encountering and learning to use a variety of libraries suited to creative coding while producing their own original work in a studio environment.


## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

* Confidently search for, find, and use JavaScript libraries in their projects
* Leverage the power of their programming alongside libraries to create compelling interactive experiences

## Key activities

### Lectures
Each class will include time spent with the instructor leading a session that introducing programming concepts and libraries through presentation, hands-on activities and code reviews.

### Weekly assignments
Some weeks will include an evaluated small assignment in which students will write their own code to practice and demonstrate their mastery of the technologies covered.

### Projects
There will be three graded projects during the course. Each will be used as an opportunity for students to practice and develop their programming skills within a provided framework, but with more room for their own creative ideas.

### Studio
All classes will include significant time for students to work on their projects and exercises with the instructor and a teaching assistant present to support both their technical and conceptual approach.


## Expected skills

Students are expected to already be familiar with the core elements of JavaScript programming (including project setup, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and object-oriented programming). A review of this material will be conducted in the first class. Students are further expected to be fully committed to engaging with programming as not just a technical but as a creative practice, finding ways in which the technical skills they are learning can be deployed in expressive and interesting ways and articulating those ideas in code.


## GitHub

The course GitHub repository will contain all the resources needed for the course. The issue tracker will be used to submit assignments and projects. Students will create their own GitHub repository to store, track, and present their work.


## Evaluation

Specific evaluation requirements will be provided when assigned.

* Weekly exercises (10%)
   * 5 pass/fail exercises worth 2% each
* Projects (70%)
  * Project 1 (10%)
  * Project 2 (20% if lower grade than Project 3, 40% if higher)
  * Project 3 (40% if higher grade than Project 2, 20% if lower)
* Participation (20%)
   * Participation includes attendance, asking questions, asking for help, contributing to discussions, editing the wiki to share ideas, participating in critiques, and coming to office hours (even if it's just to show off your work!)


## French

Students have the right to write in French at Concordia. Pippin can read French fairly well, but is not fluent, so naturally this may impact the quality of feedback possible. Presenting in French is to be avoided. Given that this is a programming course, this means you are welcome to name variables and functions in French as well as to write comments in French.


## Policy

* Late work of any kind will lose one letter grade per day late, beginning immediately after the deadline (e.g. if it is two days late, work that would have received a A would lose two letter grades and receive a B+)
* Concordia University has an [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.concordia.ca/students/academic-integrity.html) which must be followed. Most importantly, although you may use code you find online, you __must credit the source by linking to it and indicating what you have used__.
* It is departmental policy that three (3) unexcused absences results in failing the course.
* It is class policy that being fifteen (15) or more minutes late without a reasonable excuse counts as an absence.


## Costs

* The compulsory per semester [departmental fee ($50)](https://stores.concordia.ca/catalog/product/view/id/59193/s/usage-of-consumable-materials-at-d-cart-labs-and-equipment-borrowing-privileges-from-cda-197b1b/) covering lab maintenance, workshops, and equipment borrowing privileges from the depot.
* Students who plan to use the lab computers will need [a CDA account ($45)](http://www.concordia.ca/finearts/cda/membership.html).
* All software students are expected to use in the class will be free.

## The lab

The practical work done in this class will take place in the computer labs EV 5.815 and EV 5.635 which contain dual-boot Mac/Windows machines. In order to use the machines you will need a CDA account (as above). In addition, it is vital to know and remember that **the computers do not keep work that you leave on their hard-drives**. As we will be working with version control, however, this should not be an issue.

You are of course welcome to use your own laptops and computers to the extent that you are able to install and manage the appropriate software on it, and the instructor will work to support that within reason.
