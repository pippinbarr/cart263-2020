## Brief

This project has an open brief in terms of subject matter and technology. Make something you find interesting/inspiring/hilarious/exciting/etc. If you want to work from a starting idea, here are some (random) suggestions:

- A vision of the future of social media (e.g. life with Facebook in 2050???)
- A retro version of an existing web experience (e.g. a text-based version of YouTube???)
- A sentient webpage with feelings and an agenda (e.g. HAL, but on the web???)
- A game that requires the player to act like a web developer (e.g. playing requires reading the code, typing things into the console, secret messages, secret URLs, window resizing, ...)
- A website that plays other websites as music (e.g. it loads the HTML of another website and then analyses it to create a musical score)

---

## Requirements

- Must be interactive
- Must use JavaScript as the primary form of artistic expression (e.g. code is the central aspect of the work)
- Must incorporate at least __two__ libraries/frameworks
- Must include an __Artist's Statement__ as a `README.md` in the project folder that explains the creative ideas behind the project (roughly 500 words)

__All technical requirements are open to discussion if you have a specific direction in mind.__

## Grading

Grading for exercises is based on the following three categories (with associated weightings):

__Implementation (50%)__. Runs without errors. Meets the key technical requirements. Exhibits complexity/ambition of code. Uses technical ideas and features that go beyond what has been seen in class. Has clear indication of code obtained from other sources (e.g. StackExchange, examples on website). Code is well-structured and easy to understand.

__Creativity (30%)__. Uses code to create an interesting and expressive experience for the user. Has a clear point of view and conveys it well. Uses code in surprising ways to create new ideas. Goes beyond the most obvious uses of the chosen technologies. Artist's statement clearly explains the design and implementation in terms of its desire effect.

__Style (20%)__. the code is well-commented, well-formatted and indented, uses good names for variables, functions, classes, etc., attributes the use of pre-existing code, and has a good number of commits with well-written commit messages that include the project prefix "P3:".
