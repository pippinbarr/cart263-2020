# Assignment 2: Slamina Special

__Grade__: 2% of final grade (see grading guidelines at bottom)  
__Deadline__: 11:59PM on the day of class on week of 27 January 2020.

## Brief

- Incorporate annyang! into the experience by allowing players to:
  - Give up on a round by saying "I give up". This should shake the correct answer and then generate a new round
  - Ask to hear the (reversed) name of the animal again by saying "Say it again"
  - Speak their guesses in the form "I think it is X" where X is the name of the animal and have the answer be checked just like it would be with a click on the correct button
- Include a running score on the page of consecutive correct answers, reset to 0 if they get one wrong or they give up

__NOTE__: This is the bare minimum of additions in order to pass, please always use these assignments as a playground to try out more than the bare minimum!
