# Challenge 3: Music Box

__Optional challenge__

---

## Brief

- Prevent each mouse click from starting the music interval again! You only want to start the music one time.
- Change the code so that the synth doesn't necessarily play a note _every_ beat (i.e. it can have rests/silences). (You'll need to be able to explicitly _stop_ the synth if there's going to be a silence.)
- Change the code so that the synth can play notes of different durations that are multiples of the basic note length. (You'll need to use `setTimeout()` to play notes instead of `setInterval()` so you can vary the duration of the delay to the next note.)
- Use Pizzicato to add filters to the synth and the drum sounds so that you get a more interesting sound out of the instruments.

__NOTE:__ This brief is the bare minimum of additions, please always use these assignments as a playground to try out more than the bare minimum! Extra ideas to consider: visualisation of the music as it plays, varying the parameters of the filters over time or based on user interaction, changing the key of the music, changing between multiple drum patterns, etc.!
