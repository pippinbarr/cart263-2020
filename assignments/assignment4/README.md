# Assignment 4: Condiments Cacophony

__Grade__: 2% of final grade (see grading guidelines at bottom)  
__Deadline__: 11:59PM on the day of class on week of 16 March 2020.

## Brief

- __More descriptions__. Add at least two (or more) descriptive elements to the condiment by including more datasets from the [corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/tree/master/data)
- __Fix the indefinite article__. Currently the code always uses 'a' in front of nouns, even when 'an' is appropriate. Write code that checks if the word following an indefinite article (e.g. 'a') starts with a vowel and use 'an' instead in that case
- Allow the user to refresh the description by clicking on the page rather than having to reload it

__NOTE:__ This brief is the bare minimum of additions in order to pass, please always use these assignments as a playground to try out more than the bare minimum!
